I design and operate cloud infrastructure. I automate deployments, secure access, and improve reliability. My work reduces incident volume and shortens delivery time.

I prefer small, measurable wins: cut manual steps, reduce toil, and ship features faster.

### Highlights

- Built Terraform-based infrastructure for secure remote access.
- Implemented CI/CD pipelines that cut release time by 40%.
- Managed production Linux fleets with automated monitoring and alerts.
- Experience with AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus.
- Strong scripting in Go, Python, and Bash.
